# ðŸŽ¯ Risk Measure Optimization and Simulation (CVaR, VaR, EVaR, Variance)



## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project implements a **Monte Carlo simulation** framework for evaluating and optimizing different **financial risk measures**, specifically:

- **CVaR** (Conditional Value at Risk)  
- **VaR** (Value at Risk)  
- **EVaR** (Entropic Value at Risk)  
- **Variance**

The model simulates a foreign exchange ($/â‚¬) exposure related to **student funding programs**, and optimizes hedging strategies using **call options** on the exchange rate.

The goal is to **minimize the chosen risk measure** by simulating random scenarios of:
- the number of students,
- future exchange rates,  
and computing the total cost in euros under each scenario.

## Requirements
To correctly run the project, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:
```plaintext
gurobipy==11.0.3
matplotlib==3.5.1
numpy==1.20.3
scipy==1.10.1
```
The random and time modules are part of Pythonâ€™s standard library (no need to install).
The Python version used is 3.12.4. Furthermore, an active license is required for Gurobi.

After installing the dependencies, simply run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```
